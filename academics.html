           <p>IGD120 Graphics, Audio & Video Editing</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Offering a background in Adobe Photoshop & Premier Pro, IGD was a good choice for the advancing of photo-manipulation and video editing techniques which keeps options open for the future. As I am attempting to keep my skill set as broad as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CO120 Programming and Software Development</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The more difficult of my module choices. CO120 teaches from the ground up the programming language Java and how to process data and perform actions. With future uses of this to create my own Javascript plugins and scripts for websites this is one of my challenges which I am enjoying greatly.</p>

            <p>With another step up the academic ladder comes adjustments necessary for the level of work we will be undertaken. However its not all dissertations and gloom just yet! For most, going to university is an opportunity to specialize further from secondary education subjects and with that comes a more passionate outcome. At the beginning of the semester we had to select our modules for the year ahead. After a long, hard look over the large range of modules on offer, I chose the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MU130 Introduction to Web Development</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This module is comprised of the more technical aspects of web authoring. With research into current examples and designs we began designing our own websites and creating the elements using a range of different techniques such as DIV CSS layouts. All of which is on the theme of University Life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MU120 Digital Media Design and Development</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The more creative brother/sister to the MU130 module. Comprised mainly of Adobe Flash practical work and design theory. Our first assignment being to create an interactive map of a european country using animation and vector art to make it visually appealing and entertaining.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
